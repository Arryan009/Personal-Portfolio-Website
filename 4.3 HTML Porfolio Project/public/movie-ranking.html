<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This is my favourite bollywood movie. It has a mixture of comedy, college life and romance of course.</p>
<h3>James Bond: No Time to Die</h3>
<p>Really cool story and action at the same time what we can expect from james bond movies</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious X</h3>
<p>The story was really wherein all the characters end up helping each other to fight a single enemy.</p>
